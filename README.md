# Salary Classification with Ensemble Models and XGBoost

## Disclaimer
This project was exported directly from Kaggle. If you intend to run it locally, you may need to modify paths, adjust package versions, or update the way data is loaded.

This repository contains a mini machine learning project focused on predicting whether an individual earns more or less than \$50k based on demographic and work-related features. The project includes a full pipeline: exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training multiple classification models.

## Project Structure
- **1. Introduction** - Overview of the problem and objectives  
- **2. Load the Data** - Importing and inspecting the dataset  
- **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visual analysis of:  
  - age distribution  
  - education level  
  - workclass, occupation, relationship, and other categorical variables  
- **4. Data Preprocessing**  
  - handling missing values  
  - encoding categorical variables  
  - feature scaling  
  - train-test split  
- **5. Modeling**  
  - baseline classifiers  
  - ensemble methods  
  - XGBoost model  
  - model comparison and evaluation

## Results
The notebook presents performance comparisons across several models, showing the benefits of using ensemble approaches and XGBoost for the salary classification task. Evaluation includes accuracy metrics and feature importance inspection.
